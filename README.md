## Version 2.0.0
This version of the Attendance App includes the core functionalities as described in the preview video. The app currently uses **SQFlite** for local data storage, and there is no login/signup system implemented at this stage. The state management is basic and will be enhanced in future releases using **ChangeNotifierProvider** or **BLoC**.
